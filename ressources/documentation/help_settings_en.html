    <h2>LAEQ-Cartographic Correlation<br>Settings Tab</h2>
    <p>Here you can tinker the settings inside our function to obtain the expected result</p>

    <h4>Limit stop speed: </h4>
    <p>This slider represent the limit where we will consider every point with a speed value inferior to it at the stop status</p>

    <h3>Topological tolerance</h3>
    <h4>Close call :</h4>
    <p>This slider represent the length at wich we will consider that two point touch each other and need to be merged </p>

    <h4>Intersection and Dangle Nodes :</h4>
    <p>Because of the topological functions that truncate the coordinates of every geometry, we need a tolerance value to identify which points are connected together.</p>

    <h3>Map-matching tolerance :</h3>
    <h4>Searching radius</h4>
    <p>This slider is a parameter in the map matching function that represent the searching radius of a possible path around every point</p>

    <h4>Sigma</h4>
    <p>This slider is a parameter in the map matching function that represent the probabilities that a road have to be taken considering it's distance to the point. (greater = more likely) </p>
