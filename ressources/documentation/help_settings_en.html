    <h2>Assisted-MapMatching<br>Settings Tab</h2>
    <p>Here you can modify the settings of the mapmatching process to adjust the algorithms' behaviors to your data.</p>

    <h4>Stop speed threshold: </h4>
    <p> Enter the value of the speed threshold under which we will consider that points are not moving.</p>

    <h3>Topological tolerance</h3>
    <h4>Close call: </h4>
    <p> Enter the value representing the distance threshold under which two nodes should be connected.</p>

    <h4>Intersection and Dangle Nodes: </h4>
    <p> Enter the value representing the distance threshold under which two segments should be connected / are intersecting. This value is needed to avoid errors induced by imprecision in decimals of the geometries' coordinates. The recommanded value is 0.01</p>

    <h3>Map-matching tolerance</h3>
    <h4>Searching radius: </h4>
    <p> This value represents the searching radius around every points used by the map-matching function to find a likely path on the street network.</p>

    <h4>Sigma</h4>
    <p> This value is used to calculate the probability that a points must be matched on a specific road, based on the distance between the two geometries. The biggest sigma is, the slowest is the decay in probability with distance.</p>
