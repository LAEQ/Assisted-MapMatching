    <h2>LAEQ-Cartographic Correlation<br>Matching Tab</h2>
    <p>This plugin match a trajectory on a network</p>
    <h3>Quick description</h3>
    <p>In order to complete the process, you will have to go through 3 step:<br><br>
    <strong>Step 1: Input</strong>    --> This step prepare the data for the Matching.<br>
    <strong>Step 2: Matching</strong> --> This is the step where you will match your point on the network and correct manualy potential error from the algorithm.<br>
    <strong>Step 3: Export</strong>   --> This step is where you can export your result. You can also do it manualy.

    <h3>Network Layer : </h3>
    <p>This dropDown list show all layers of type <strong>LineString</strong> that are active in the current QGIS project </p>
    <h3>Path Layer : </h3>
    <p>This dropDown list show all layers of type <strong>Point</strong> that are active in the current QGIS project </p>
    <h3>OID :</h3>
    <p>This dropDown list show all the feature of type <strong>"Integer/Integer64/int/int8"</strong> present inside of the Path layer selected. It represent the original ID of every points</p>
    <h3>Speed :</h3>
    <p>This dropDown list show all the feature of type <strong>Real/double</strong> of the Path layer selected. It represent the speed at wich the measurement was taken</p>
    <h3>Buffer range :</h3>
    <p>This slider represent the maximum distance to find line on the network for each trajectory point. The bigget this value is, the longest the computing time </p>
    <h3>The plugin isn't working:</h3>

    <p>Here is a few tips that could be the reason why the plugin doesn't work: <br><br>
      Your layers aren't conform to the plugin standards:
      <dd>- Check that your two layers are active (checked) or they won't be detected </dd><br>
      <dd>- Check your two layers geometry's type are LineString for one and Point for the other </dd><br>
      <dd>- Check that your two layers are in the same projection system (SCR) and that they are both in meter (cartesian) </dd><br>
      <dd>- Check that your path layer (Point) has an OID field and a speed field (if not uncheck the box next to the comboBox) </dd><br>
      <dd>- Try reloading if you corrected the precedent error and nothing appeared </dd><br>
