    <h2>Assisted-MapMatching<br>Matching Tab</h2>
    <p>This plugin aims to adjust a GPS track on a network (map-matching) semi-automatically<br>We recommend that you read the plugin documentation before using it: <a href="https://github.com/LAEQ/q3m">link</a></p>
    <h3>Quick description of the matching process</h3>
    <p>The map-matching process has 3 successive steps</p>

    <h3># Step 1: Input</h3>
    <p>This step prepare the data to facilitate the work of the map-matching algorithms. 
      It correct the topology of the network and verify the validity of the input. <br> 
      Fill every fields, then reduce and correct the network in order to reach the next step.<br>
      Here is the description of every fields:</p>

      <h4>Network layer: </h4>
    <p>&emsp; This dropDown list show all layers of type <strong>LineString</strong> that are active on QGIS.
      Select the layer on wich you want to adjust your GPS track<br>
    The type <stron>MultilineString</stron> isn't supported. You can convert your <strong>MultiLineString</strong> layer to a <strong>LineString</strong> layer with the tool "Multipart to SingleParts" of QGIS.</p>
	  
      <h4>GPS trace layer: </h4>
    <p>&emsp; This dropDown list show all layers of type <strong>Point</strong> that are active on QGIS.
      Select the layer that you want to match to a network.</p>
    
      <h4>OID (Object identifier) :</h4>
    <p>&emsp; This dropDown list show all the attributes of type <strong>"Integer/Integer64/int/int8"</strong> present in the selected GPS trace. This field must be an unique identifier of every points and is used to order them. A point present earlier on the trace must have a smaller number than another present later.</p>
    
      <h4>Buffer range: </h4>
    <p>&emsp; This slider represent the maximum distance to find line on the selected network for each trajectory point. The bigger this value is, the longest the computing time</p>

    <h3># Step 2: Matching</h3>
    <p>This step match the points of the GPS trace on the network (already prepared for this). If the map-matching algorithm made a mistake, the user can correct by selecting the path used manually and applicate the changes. (that will restart the map-matching algorithm on the new selection)<br> 
      Two field can be completed:  </p>
    
      <h4>Speed :</h4>
    <p>&emsp;This dropDown list show all the attributes of type <strong>"Integer/Integer64/int/int8"</strong> present in the selected GPS trace. It represent the speed at which every point has been taken. This field is necessary only if you use the matching method "matching with speed". </p>
    
      <h4>ComboBox Matching algorithm</h4>
    <p>&emsp; This dropDown list allow you to choose the type of matching. Three option are available.</p>
	 <ul>
	 	 <li>Matching with speed : Taking into account the speed, the GPS trace is cutted into mooving or stopped section. Every points of a stopped section are merged at their average location and snapped to their closest location on the selected line on the network. The mooving section are then adjusted between the sections separated by the groups of stopped point. Check the documentation for more detail.</li><br>
	 	 <li>Matching by distance: This method adjust the points along the path by taking into account the distance between every points and the ratio between the length of the original track (in between each points), and the path selected.</li><br>
	 	 <li>Matching to closest : This methode simply project every points to the closest road on the selected path.</li>
	 </ul> 

   <h3># Step 3: Export</h3>
    <p>This step allow you to export your datas to the selected format. You can also do it manually from QGIS<br> 
      Three options are available to you:</p>

    <h4>Export matched trace</h4>
    <p>&emsp; This option allow you to export the selected matched track present in the dropDown list next to it under the format specified in the settings.</p>

    <h4>Export the polyline</h4>
    <p>&emsp; This option allow you to export the polyline representing the path used by the cyclist.</p>

    <h4>Export project</h4>
    <p>&emsp; This option allow you to export every elements coched in the settings inside a single file.</p>
